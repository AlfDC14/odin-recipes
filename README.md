# This is a little project testing the use of links and images, in this case for Recipes.

# Continuing with the foundation course, I applied some basic CSS to the project, nothing to fancywanted to  display all images with the links next to each other but I believe that will be covered in a future lesson so I didn't give too much thought to it

# As I imagined block, inline, inline-block were introduced in the next lesson so I managed to change the homepage a little bit as I initially wanted to, was a bit tricky to set everything but I believed it will be far easier when I get to the flexbox css / grid part (I think?). Also added a new folder with images of how my homepage will be changing as I progress to the course.
